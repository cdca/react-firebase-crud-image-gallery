# Image Gallery CRUD

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

You dont have to config anything. I left my Firebase API key so you can have easier time building this app.

# About

This is very simple app that has standard CRUD functionalities. It has been made with Firebase DB, Sorage and Auth. Those 3 services are extremely well coordinated and thats why it is very easy to work with them. In this app like in any other you can register, login, have your profile with uploaded pictures, remove iamge, etc. There are some minor things that could be better written but I just dont have time at the moment. You can implement several things, like favourite images, random image, comments, likes etc. I had that in mind but didnt have time. Maybe in future i will add them.

### Please dont abuse my DB

Like the title says, as soon as possible put your own keys in the config file.

# Thats it

Hope you have fun time with this app. ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡
